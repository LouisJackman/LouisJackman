**A product security manager in London**. Visit [my
website](https://volatilethunk.com) for [my
articles](https://volatilethunk.com/posts.html) and **[my
CV](https://volatilethunk.com/louis-jackman-cv.pdf)**. Additional contact
information like **my [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/louis-jackman)**
[is there too](https://volatilethunk.com/pages/about.html).

Aside from the usual **InfoSec, management, and advisory efforts**, I keep an
eye on [LangSec](https://langsec.org/), capability-based-security, declarative
computing, concurrency, PLT, and general software engineering practices. I've
personally created technological solutions for companies' messy, real-world
production problems in **Java**, **TypeScript/JavaScript**, **Python**, and
**Rust** â€” atop **Linux**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS**. Some other
technologies also show up in personal projects: C, Clojure, Scheme, and ELisp.

This GitHub profile serves mostly as a mirror for [my GitLab
profile](https://gitlab.com/louis.jackman). File issues or PRs there instead,
if you can.
