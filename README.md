**A product security manager in London**. Visit [my
website](https://volatilethunk.com) for **[my
CV](https://volatilethunk.com/louis-jackman-cv.pdf)** and [my
articles](https://volatilethunk.com/posts.html). Additional contact
information like **my [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/louis-jackman)**
[is there too](https://volatilethunk.com/pages/contact.html).

Aside from the usual **InfoSec, management, and advisory efforts**, I have
interest in [LangSec](https://langsec.org/),
[capability-based-security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security),
[declarative computing](https://guix.gnu.org/), concurrency,
[metaprogramming](https://letoverlambda.com/), [programming language theory
(PLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory), [libre
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software), and general software
engineering practices. I've personally created technological solutions for
companies' messy, real-world production problems in **Java**,
**TypeScript/JavaScript**, **Python**, and **Rust** â€” atop **Linux**,
**Kubernetes**, and **AWS**. Some other technologies also show up in personal
projects: C, Clojure, Scheme, and ELisp.

This GitHub profile serves mostly as a mirror for [my GitLab
profile](https://gitlab.com/louis.jackman). File issues or PRs there instead,
if you can.
